  abstract={
    Even with improvements in machine learning enabling robots to quickly 
optimize and perfect their skills, developing a seed skill from which to begin 
an optimization remains a necessary challenge for large action spaces.  This 
paper proposes a method for creating and using such a seed by i) observing the 
effects of the actions of another robot, ii) further optimizing the skill 
starting from this seed, and iii) embedding the optimized skill in a full 
behavior.  Called KSOBI, this method is fully implemented and tested in the 
complex RoboCup 3D simulation domain.  To the best of our knowledge, the 
resulting skill kicks the ball farther in this simulator than has been 
previously documented.

    This paper presents a base code release by the UT Austin Villa RoboCup 3D 
simulation team from the University of Texas at Austin.  The code release, 
based off the 2015 UT Austin Villa RoboCup champion agent, but with some 
features such as high level strategy removed, provides a fully functioning 
agent and good starting point for new teams to the RoboCup 3D simulation 
league.  Additionally the code release offers a foundational platform for 
conducting research in multiple areas including robotics, multiagent systems, 
and machine learning.

abstract="Particle swarm optimization (PSO) has undergone many changes since its introduction in 1995. As researchers have learned about the technique, they have derived new versions, developed new applications, and published theoretical studies of the effects of the various parameters and aspects of the algorithm. This paper comprises a snapshot of particle swarming from the authors' perspective, including variations in the algorithm, current and ongoing research, applications and open problems.",
